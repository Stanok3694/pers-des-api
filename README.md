# pers-des-api

This is back-end for personal-desicions app. Several REST API methods and connections with MongoDB by Mongoose.

ToDo (most important):

1.	add updateWorker method;
2.	rework schema and model for more consistent + faster loading and decrease callback-hell <- one model: workerModel;
3.	functionality which is related with "Объект" entity.

Nice to have: 
* gulp;
* more test-coverage <- more unit-tests + add integration tests;
* lint before commit / push.
